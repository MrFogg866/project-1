        <h1>Norwich Castle</h1>
        
        <p>Norwich Castle was designed to be a royal palace rather than a fortification. However, no Norman kings ever lived in it. The only time Henry I is known to have stayed at Norwich Castle was for Christmas 1121, a visit explored in detail in the displays in the Castle Keep.

            Norwich Castle keep was built using limestone shipped from Caen in France at a cost of over three times the original value of the stone!</p>
            
            <img src="assets/image/framlingham castle.jpeg" alt="framlingham-castle">
        <h1>Framlingham Castle </h1>
        <p>Surrounded by parkland and a picturesque lake, Framlingham Castle was once at the centre of a vast network of power and influence. Muster your courage,walk the spectacular wall walk and explore the towering walls behind which Mary Tudor was proclaimed Queen of England. From the remarkable 10.5 metres high curtain wall, take in breath-taking views of the Suffolk landscape and imagine life over 500 years ago.</p>
        
        <img src="assets/image/rising castle .jpeg" alt="rising-castle">
        <h1>Rising Castle</h1>
        <p>One of the largest, best preserved and most lavishly decorated keeps in England, surrounded by 20 acres of mighty earthworks.

            Building of the castle was begun in 1138 by the Norman lord William d'Albini for his new wife, the widow of Henry I. In the 14th century it became the luxurious residence of Queen Isabella, widow (and alleged murderess) of Edward II.</p>
           
        <img src="assets/image/somerleyton castle.jpeg" alt="somerleyton-gardens">
        <h1>Somerleyton Gardens</h1>
        <p> Considered one of the finest gardens in East Anglia since the mid 17th century, the gardens at Somerleyton continue to delight. Set over 12 acres, the garden is slowly being re-imagined as a series of interconnected ‘rooms’…</p>
        
        <img src="assets/image/orford castle.jpeg" alt="orford-castle">
        <h1>Orford Castle</h1>
        <p>The castle was nearly finished by the time Henry II’s sons rebelled against him in 1173. The country was again thrown into civil war, and Orford was made ready to defend against attack. However, the rebellion petered out the following year before Orford's garrison saw fighting.

            Orford Castle stayed in royal control, passing from Henry II to Richard I when Henry died in 1189. When Richard I was captured while returning from crusade, Queen Eleanor, his mother, assembled a fleet at Orford to take the ransom for the king’s release.</p>
            
        <img src="assets/image/baconsthorpe castle.jpeg" alt="baconsthorpe-castle">
        <h1>Baconsthorpe Castle</h1>
        <p>The site of Baconsthorpe was acquired from the Bacon family in the early 15th century by William Baxter, a free yeoman.

            The earliest castle building, the inner gatehouse, was begun by William’s son, John (d.1479), a lawyer who had risen to prominence as a supporter and agent of William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk. He changed the family name to Heydon to disguise his comparatively lowly origins.</p>
            
        <img src="assets/image/bungay castle.jpeg" alt="bungay-castle">
        <h1>Bungay Castle</h1>
        <p> Original castle in the form of a square Norman keep was built in 1165 by a feudal Lord - Hugh Bigod and later rebuilt in 1294 by the last Bigod earl. All that remains today are the foundations up to the level of the ground floor windows. </p>
        
        <img src="assets/image/castle acre.jpeg" alt="acre-castle">
        <h1>Acre Castle</h1>
        <p>Castle Acre, a tranquil rural village in Norfolk, boasts an extraordinary wealth of history. It is a rare and complete survival of a Norman planned settlement, including a castle, village, parish church and one of the best-preserved monastic sites in England</p>
        
        <img src="assets/image/eye castle .jpeg" alt="eye-castle">
        <h1>Eye Castle</h1>
        <p>Eye Castle is one of the few surviving motte-and-bailey castles from the early Norman period. Built shortly after the Norman conquest of England in 1066, the castle was sacked and largely destroyed in 1265 but was probably used as a defensive site for many centuries before that. Now, rather than dominating the surrounding area with military might, the castle offers a tranquil, fun and interesting place to visit.</p>
        
        <img src="assets/image/thetford castle.jpeg" alt="thetford-castle">
        <h1>Thetford Castle</h1>
        <p>The substantial upstanding earthworks northwest of Castle Lane and north of Market Street, known as Castle Hill, are the remains of an Iron Age fort and a medieval motte and bailey castle. </p>
